# Gesture-Controlled Drone
## Abhay Menon, Michael Leo Kokkat, Harry Jang

This project aims to attain control over a Parrot Rolling Spider minidrone with an infrared LEAP motion capture sensor, which will monitor the motion of the controller’s hand and command the drone to move accordingly. We seek to coordinate the motion and velocity of the drone with that of the controller’s hand, wherein a change in the position of the hand will result in an according movement in the drone in all 6 degrees of freedom (translation along x, y, z axes, as well as rotational and flipping maneuvers around these axes)
