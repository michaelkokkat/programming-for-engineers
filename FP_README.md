# Gesture-Controlled Drone
## Abhay Menon, Michael Leo Kokkat, Harry Jang


### Project Summary
This project aims to attain control over a Parrot Rolling Spider minidrone with an infrared LEAP motion capture sensor, which will monitor the motion of the controller’s hand and command the drone to move accordingly.

We seek to coordinate the motion and velocity of the drone with that of the controller’s hand, in all 6 degrees of freedom (translation along x, y, z axes, as well as rotational and flipping maneuvers around these axes).

### Instructions
Our program requires two dependency packages:
  Leap Motion Developer SDK (along with Desktop Setup of the Leap Motion Sensor)
  pyparrot (Python Interface for Parrot Drones)

We have included all the necessary libraries in this folder, but the Leap Motion Sensor's Desktop Setup will have to be installed separately. The Setup can be found (here)[https://www.leapmotion.com/setup/desktop/linux/]
